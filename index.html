        <div class="content1"> Hello! I'm Stephan. I am a business owner, graphic designer, and burgeoning web developer.
            After spending 14 years in the wholesale screenprinting and embroidery industry building a successful business,
            I had a moment of intense introspective reflection and realized how very, very bored I was. So I did what any
            reasonable husband/father-of-three/self-employed individual would do in that situation; I put the business on auto-pilot and sought out
            a career in a field I had absolutely zero experience in! 
            I signed up for a 6-month 'coding bootcamp' through Michigan State University and started learning full-stack web development.
            This is an ongoing journey that is only just beginning for me and I cannot wait to see where it goes! Also, perhaps, you
            may consider hiring me someday. Thanks!</div>
